# hello-world
I am a lecturer in the Dept. of Computing at the University of the West Indies, Mona.  
I teach Analysis of Algorithms, Language Processors and Theory of Computation.
Recently, I have become interested in competitive programming, and I have been looking at ways to incorporate some of its
elements into my courses, especially the ones that involve programming.
